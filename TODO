Features:

- support project configuration
- support hg log and Ncover report
- calculate x-axis according to max commits and y-axis according to complexity
- show multiple project reports in one page with ajax
- support svn log and sonar report


- write a NCoverParser to generate required data format for complexity and coverage using cwp report.
- generate report both for complexity and coverage
- load code commits after system startup to improve efficiency

* Improve User experience

- using bmc sample to fix the hardcoded svn parser
- add test for different scenarios ( hg&java, hg&csharp, svn&java, svn&csharp, hg&c++ ...)
- make configuration easier (regex for parse vcs log?)

- improve user guide
